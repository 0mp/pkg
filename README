pkgng is a binary package manager written from scratch for FreeBSD.

pkgng is built on top of libpkg, a new library to interface with package registration backends.
It abstracts package management details such as registration, remote repositories, package creation,
updating, etc.

The planned feature set includes:
- smooth integration with bsd.port.mk and the current pkg_* programs
- the register command can analyse elf files when registering a new port to
  discover forgotten dependencies if necessary.
- the register command has two modes available: when dealing with older
  ports it just registers the package, in the 'new' mode it does everything that would
  have been done by pkg_add when installing the package: show messages,
  executing post-install, executing @exec etc.
- pkg add supports two modes : the old fashion one (no real upgrade support) and
  new one: upgrade scripts executed.
- supports new scripts: +PREINSTALL +POSTINSTALL, +PREDEINSTALL, +POSTDEINSTALL,
  +PREUPGRADE, +POSTUPGRADE as well as the original scripts : +INSTALL
  +DEINSTALL +UPGRADE
- new +MANIFEST (plist-like format) with new metadata: options, arch, os
  version, etc.
- pkgng supports checking the arch of the package which means that users
  won't be able to install sparc64 binary package on amd64 machines.
- a special architecture "all" is used to specify when a package can be used
  on every architecture. Support for lists of valid architectures is being worked on.
- @dirrm and @dirrmtry are now deprecated, pkgng can discover itself which
  directory has to be removed.
- new repository (apt-like feature)
- support for the dragons in bsd.xorg.mk
- real support for reverse dependency (no ugly +REQUIRED_BY)
- unit test (libcheck) on libpkg
- many more

pkgng is a binary package manager written from scratch for FreeBSD.

pkgng is built on top of a new libpkg, which allow to deal with the database of
installed packages, to deal with remote repositories, manage packages: creation,
installation gathering informations, registering new ports.

features supported are or will be :
- smooth integration with bsd.port.mk (including bsd.pkg.mk line 2486) which allow
  to have a bsd.port.mk which deal with both pkg_install and pkgng.
- the register command can analyse elf files when registering a new port to
  discover forgotten dependency if necessary.
- the register command has two mode available: when dealing with old fashion
  ports it just registers the package, in new mode it does everything that would
  have been done by pkg add when installing the package: show messages,
  executing post-install, executing @exec etc.
- pkg add supports two mode : the old fashion one (no real upgrade support) and
  new one: upgrade scripts supported.
- new scripts supported +PREINSTALL +POSTINSTALL, +PREDEINSTALL, +POSTDEINSTALL,
  +PREUPGRADE, +POSTUPGRADE as well as the old fashion scripts : +INSTALL
  +DEINSTALL +UPGRADE
- new +MANIFEST (plist-like format) whith new metadatas : options, arch, os
  version, etc.
- pkgng supports checking arch of the package which means that users
  won't be able to install sparc64 binary package into amd64 machines.
- a special architecture "all" allows to specify when a package can be used
  on every architecture.
- @dirrm and @dirrmtry are now deprecated, pkgng can discover itself which
  directory has to be removed.
- new repository (apt-like feature)
- real support for reverse dependency (no ugly +REQUIRED_BY)
- test unit (libcheck) on libpkg.
- many more

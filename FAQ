Q: Is there an equivalent for pkg-orphan/pkg_cutleaves with pkgng?
A: pkg autoremove is what you are looking for

Q: How pkgng is different from FreeBSD pkg_* tools? What is the motivation
behind pkgng?
A: The README should explain all of that :)

Q: How pkgng is different from PC-BSD pbi packages?
A: pbi are flat/complete packages, where pkgng do package ports as there are.

Q: What is the difference between pkg delete -y and pkg delete -f?
A: By default pkgng will ask before doing something, -y = yes means yes do it,
but if a package is depend on it will fail saying it is depend on, -f == force
means that delete it anyway.

Q: Where is pkg info -R, the old pkg_info had -R?
A: New flags: pkg info -d == depends on and -r == reverse dependencies.

Q: Can pkgng replace a package with an another version, eg. pkg upgrade pkg-1.0
pkg-2.0?
A: Currently not, but it is in the todo list.

Q: How pkgng deals with dependencies? If pkgA-1.0 depends on pkgB-1.0 and
pkgB-1.0 is updated to pkgB-2.0, will pkgA notice the change?
A: pkgA will automatically notice the change

Q: The documented (README) way to create a new repository creates all packages
in one directory. This is different from earlier repository format (separate
directories). Will pkgng adapt the old format?
A: Pkgng doesn't depend on a hierarchy, it recursively find the packages from
the provided directory entry.

Q: Does 'pkg repo' include symlinked packages?
A: The default hierarchy has lots of symlinks which should just be ignored and
thus pkgng doesn't read symlinks.

Q: pkng repository doesn't support packages with same origin (ports path). How
do I know if I have package with same origin?
A: sh -c 'find . -name "*.txz" -exec pkg query -f {} %o \;' | uniq -d

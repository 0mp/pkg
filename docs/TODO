ALPHA
- use pkg_error_* everywhere in libpkg (pkg_create.c to do)
- pkg add (client) need to fetch files if arg is an URL
- add facility in libpkg to fetch files so we can use it for pkg add (client)
  and later to dowload packages from repo, and even to download the repo.db.
that means a function with a callback to display progress.
- pkg version (comparison against ports tree and INDEX)
- bsd.pkgng.mk to easier testing
- pkg register (add -F option to force registering a package already registred)

pkgdb.cache HOW TO (Draft)
key/value store using tinycdb

Needs:
- loop over all packages
- build depend tree for a given package
- find extra info for each packages
- request a remote database

key			value

(char*)"count"		(size_t)nb_packages
[...]
(size_t)N		(char*) package N name+version
[...]

note that packages are 0-indexed

(char*)$name+$version	(size_t)N (package index)
(char*)$name			(size_t)N (package index)
(char*)$Nn				(char*)package N name
(char*)$Nv				(char*)package N version
(char*)$Nc				(char*)package N comment
(char*)$Nd				(char*)package N desc
(char*)$No				(char*)package N origin
(char*)$ND				(char**)[dep0_version, dep1_version ...]

__future__

(char*)$Np				(char*)package N path
		--> fetch from $PACKAGESITE/$path etc (useless ?)

(char*)$Ns				(char*)package N checksum (for a package)
(char*)$NC				(char*)"$conflict0 $conflict1 ..." package N conflicts

Why N -> name+version
=> to loop over all packages
Why name+version -> N
=> to get package depends without re-looping over all packages
Why name -> N
=> to get package depends with a version mismatch
